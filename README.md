A website created for a Japanese English conversation school.

In order to keep things easily maintainable by the owners, news feed like functionality was fed from the school's tumbler account using tags to filter the data. Webframes linking to google speadsheets displayed the school's schedule and price list.

The site has since been migrated to squarespace since the owner didn't want the hassel of maintaining a webserver.
